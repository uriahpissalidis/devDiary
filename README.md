I attempted to naively solve the leetcode daily today (354 Russian Doll Envelopes), I thought if I added the elements in increments of two it would solve the "russian doll problem." It didn't work :( I learned there is a built-in binary search method in python (bisect). I looked at the solution to figure out how it works however I still don't really understand what the author wrote so I'm going to deep dive the solution on Saturday.<br><br>

I'm going to attempt to solve the backend assessment today for a possible job interview in the future, continue to work through CA's SQL course, work for an hour through the Udemy Frontend course I purchased and then figure out what I need to learn for the <b>Java Dev requirements</b> 

===

## General requirements:
Automated Testing, CI/CD, Agile methodologies

## Java Dev requirements:
Springboot, Kafka, OO Oriented-programming
