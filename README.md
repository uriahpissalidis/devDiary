tracking progress here!<br>

### 05/30/22

Realized we are almost halfway through the year and that kind of scares me, I have made a lot of progress but I'm not sure I have much to show to potential employers. The goal as of right now is to make myself employable, so I'm going to continue learning through the frontend course on udemy and learn JS and React more thoroughly. I also want to learn how to build APIs with Flask, Node and Springboot. I might even go back and finis the CI/CD course, however it seems kind of... pointless, I am a solo dev I don't need all of these tools.

Solved leetcode 268, going to do some more of the frontend Udemy course before calling it a day. Yesterday I did more leetcode, I think the commits are already up. I also am considering starting to learn AWS certifications, I think they could only help moving forward. Light day today, I had to go and look at a wedding venue with my fiance, strongly considering this one :)

I attempted to naively solve the leetcode daily today (354 Russian Doll Envelopes), I thought if I added the elements in increments of two it would solve the "russian doll problem." It didn't work :( I learned there is a built-in binary search method in python (bisect). I looked at the solution to figure out how it works however I still don't really understand what the author wrote so I'm going to deep dive the solution on Saturday.<br><br>

I'm going to attempt to solve the backend assessment today for a possible job interview in the future, continue to work through CA's SQL course, work for an hour through the Udemy Frontend course I purchased and then figure out what I need to learn for the <b>Java Dev requirements</b> <br>
<br>
<b>==End of Day==</b>
I figured out that Springboot is a Java framework and Flask is a Python framework, both for APIs while I was doing research for the backend assessment from Hatchways.io for a prospective company. I'm not entirely sure how they work yet but I am on the right path for figuring out how they work! Did some more SQL but I didn't do the Udemy course today, tomorrow I will make up for the lost time. I got sucked into the backend research.
